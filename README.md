# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Objective
To analyze customer churn behavior in the telecom industry and quantify its revenue impact to support data-driven retention strategies.

## Dataset
- ~100,000 customer records
- Synthetic telecom dataset from Kaggle

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Hypothesis Testing
- Business & Revenue Analysis

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Churn vs Monthly Charges hypothesis testing
- Revenue impact of churned customers
- Identification of high-value churn customers (top 10%)

## Key Insights
- Customers with higher monthly charges have a higher probability of churn
- A small segment of high-value customers contributes disproportionately to revenue loss
- Long-term contract customers show significantly lower churn

## Business Recommendations
- Target high-value churn customers with personalized retention offers
- Encourage customers to move to long-term contracts
- Monitor pricing thresholds that increase churn risk
